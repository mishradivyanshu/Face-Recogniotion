# Face-Recogniotion
Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories:

Face Verification - "is this the claimed person?". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem.
Face Recognition - "who is this person?". A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces.
